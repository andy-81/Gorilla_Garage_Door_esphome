# Gorilla_Garage_Door_esphome
Garage Door Controller for Gorilla/Teleco Garage Door

I thought I would share details of how I ended up integrating my Gorilla/Teleco garage door into Home assistant via esphome. In theory it could be used with any platform that supports esphome.

ToDo: 
Write up details
Create Wiring diagram
Mark Up yaml code better
